You still cross my mind from time to time, and I mostly smile
Still so set on finding out where we went wrong and why
So I retrace our every step with an unsure pen
Trying to figure out what my head thinks
But my head just ain't what it used to be
And then again, what's the point anyway?
I remember you ascending all the stairs, up to the balcony
To see if you could see me hidden quietly away
I remember the skin of your fingers
The spot three-quarters up I'd always touch when I was out of things to say
You held my hand, but you were too afraid to speak
You were too afraid to speak and I could never understand
I remember when you leaned in quick to kiss me
And I swear not a single force on earth could stop the trembling of my hand
I remember how you smiled through the smoke
In a crowded little coffeehouse and laughed at all my jokes
And I remember the way that you dressed
How we wasted all the best of us in alcohol and sweat
And I remember when I knew that you'd be leaving, how I barely kept up breathing
And I bet if I had to do it all again, I'd feel the same pain
I remember panicked circles in the terminal in tears
How I wept to God in fits, I've hated airports ever since
